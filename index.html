<h1>2020<br>The Year the World Paused</h1>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="date">December 2019 – Wuhan</span>
  <p>
    A few people in a wet market started coughing.  
    Doctors posted worrying X-rays on WeChat.  
    The word <span class="highlight">“SARS-like”</span> appeared in hospital chat groups…  
    and then the messages were deleted.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="date">January 20, 2020</span>
  <p>
    A doctor named Li Wenliang was told to “stop making comments that disturb social order”.  
    Twenty days later he would be dead from the very virus he tried to warn people about.
  </p>
  <blockquote>
    “I regret telling them [the police] everything was fine. Seven people were summoned and warned… I felt very sad.”
  </blockquote>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="date">March 11, 2020</span>
  <p>
    <strong>WHO finally says the word:</strong> pandemic.<br>
    Stock markets had already lost ~30% in three weeks.<br>
    Toilet paper disappeared from shelves faster than facts could spread.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="date">March–May 2020</span>
  <p>
    The sound of 2020 became:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>• clapping at 8 pm for healthcare workers</li>
    <li>• Zoom meeting “you’re on mute”</li>
    <li>• “We’re all in this together” (while billionaires got $50 billion richer)</li>
    <li>• sourdough starter names</li>
    <li>• Tiger King memes at 3 a.m.</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="date">Spring–Summer 2020</span>
  <p>
    People stood six feet apart in supermarket lines wearing homemade masks that said:
  </p>
  <ul style="list-style:none; padding-left:0;">
    <li>“This is my pandemic face”</li>
    <li>“I wear this so I don’t have to wear makeup”</li>
    <li>“Jesus is my vaccine”</li>
    <li>“Mask it or casket”</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="chapter">
  <span class="date">Late 2020 – Early 2021</span>
  <p>
    The first vaccines were given.<br>
    A nurse in the UK named Margaret Keenan became the world’s first officially vaccinated person.<br>
    She was 90 years old and said: <em>“I can finally have Christmas with my family.”</em>
  </p>
</div>

<div class="ending">
  We lost millions of people.<br>
  We lost two years of normal.<br>
  <br>
  But we also learned:<br>
  • how fast science can move when the world is watching<br>
  • how fragile supply chains really are<br>
  • that teachers, nurses, shelf-stackers and delivery drivers were the actual heroes<br>
  • and that humans will still argue about anything… even breathing
