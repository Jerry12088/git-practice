# The 2020 Corona Pandemic – A Human Story

> “We didn’t just survive a virus. We survived each other.”  
> — anonymous, 2021

A short, honest README looking back at the COVID-19 pandemic (2019–2023+), written from the perspective of early 2026.

## What This Is

This is **not** a medical textbook, not epidemiology data dump, and not another timeline of press conferences.

It is a small personal/time-capsule-style document trying to remember:

- what it **felt** like at the time  
- the absurd things we did  
- the quiet heroism  
- the massive unfairness  
- the memes that kept us sane  
- how fast normal can disappear

## Quick Timeline (the parts most people actually remember)

- **Dec 2019** – something weird in Wuhan (wet market → WeChat warnings → deleted posts)
- **Jan 2020** – Li Wenliang silenced, then dies
- **Feb–Mar 2020** – Italy becomes heartbreaking live footage • toilet paper wars begin
- **Mar 11, 2020** – WHO declares pandemic
- **Mar–Jun 2020** – global lockdowns • 8pm clapping • Zoom fatigue • Tiger King
- **Summer 2020** – Black Lives Matter protests during masks & curfews
- **Nov–Dec 2020** – first vaccines (UK nurse Margaret Keenan, 90, gets shot #1)
- **2021** – vaccine rollout chaos • Delta • “you’re not boosted yet?” becomes normal
- **2022** – Omicron everywhere • most countries drop restrictions • “learning to live with it”
- **2023–2025** – long COVID clinics still full • hybrid work probably permanent • occasional new variant headlines nobody panics about anymore

## What We Lost

- ~7 million official deaths (probably 15–25 million excess deaths worldwide)
- two academic years for kids
- live music, small weddings, funerals with hugs
- certainty that tomorrow would look like today

## What We Gained (sometimes the hard way)

- Proof that science can move at warp speed when money & fear align
- That delivery drivers, shelf stockers, nurses, teachers were the actual backbone
- How to mute yourself on Zoom (a life skill now)
- That billionaires can make tens of billions **during** a global crisis
- Names like Pfizer, Moderna, AstraZeneca became household words
- The understanding that supply chains are surprisingly fragile
- sourdough starters with personalities and Instagram accounts

## Iconic 2020–2021 Vibes

- “In the before times…”
- “We’re all in this together” (followed by private jet photos)
- Dalgona coffee
- Banana bread overload
- “My mask protects you, your mask protects me”
- Zoom background fails
- “I just want to go to a barrrrr”
- The great toilet paper famine of March 2020

## Final Thought (2026 perspective)

We argued about everything:  
masks ⋅ vaccines ⋅ lockdowns ⋅ origins ⋅ ivermectin ⋅ 5G ⋅ school closures ⋅ ventilators ⋅ furlough ⋅ furlough extensions ⋅ whether sweatpants count as pants

And somehow… most of us are still here.

Many are not.

This README is mostly for people who were children or teenagers in 2020–2022 — so when you ask “what was the corona time really like?”, there’s at least one honest, human-colored answer.

Feel free to fork, add your country’s story, your personal memory, or just leave a star if you remember the clapping.
